## Intro
I’ve recently started working on my Master’s thesis! While I can’t share too many specifics just yet, I’d like to touch on the significance of what I’m working on. Throughout this journey, I’ll be posting some of my thoughts and ideas here as they develop.

As mentioned on the About page, my work focuses on digital fabrication, specifically exploring how design can be informed by the fabrication process. Geometry representation is a critical aspect of this, as it influences how information is queried and processed. Along the way, it’s been fascinating to explore how others are approaching similar challenges.

In this space, I’ll be reflecting on key concepts that have shaped the direction of my thesis.

## An Exact Solution to the Approximate Problem or an Approximate Solution to the Exact Problem
During SGP 2024, Alex Jacobson[^1] introduced an idea that resonated with me. He discussed the trade-off between high-fidelity models and precise solutions, which closely mirrored my own experience. In my earlier work, I relied on a mathematical framework that wasn’t a perfect fit for my problem. While this approach lacked full accuracy, it allowed me to leverage powerful tools to address the issue. However, this advantage came with a downside. For certain cases within my scope, the method I developed yielded poor results.  

Inspired by this concept, I decided to split my research focus. My primary focus, which forms the basis of my thesis, continues to pursue an exact solution to an approximate problem. Meanwhile, a secondary direction explores ways to better model the problem, even if it means settling for an approximate solution.
